Description: This is a cross-platform linear model to SQL compiler. It generates SQL select statements from linear and generalized linear models. Its interface consists of a single function, 'modelc', which takes the output of 'lm' or 'glm' functions (or any object which has the same signature) and outputs a SQL character vector. It currently supports gamma and Gaussian family distributions using log or identity link functions.
